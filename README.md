# SALES PREDICTION
Excited to share my Sales Prediction Project
As part of my internship with Oasis Infobyte I worked on another Machine Learning task which is Sales Prediction.The goal was to forecast product sales based on factors like advertisement spend and platform used for advertisement.

Project Highlights:
Utilized Python,Scikit-learn,NumPy,Pandas and Matplotlib to develop a robust predictive model.

Implemented Linear Regression model with transformed polynomial features making it a polynomial regression for enhanced accuracy.

Acheived the following performance metrics:
Mean Absolute Error : 0.5493
Mean Squared Error : 0.7749
R-squared : 0.97167
These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): The average absolute difference between predicted and actual sales. A lower MAE indicates better accuracy. 0.5493 is a very low MAE.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): The average squared difference between predicted and actual sales. MSE penalizes larger errors more heavily. 0.7749 is a very low MSE.
R-squared (RÂ²): Represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable (sales) that is predictable from the independent variables (advertising). A value close to 1 indicates a strong fit. 0.97167 is a very high R-squared value, showing the model fits the data extremely well.

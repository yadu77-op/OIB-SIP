# EMAIL SPAM DETECTION
As a part of my internship with Oasis Infobyte I worked on a Machine Learning task focused on Email Spam Detection.The goal of this project was to classify email as either "spam" or "ham" using advanced machine learning techniques.

Project Highlights:
Utilized Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas , NumPy, Matplotlib to develop a robust predictive model.
Implemented Random Forest Classifier.
Achieved an accuracy of 97.8%
Visualised the model's performance using confusion matrix showing its effectiveness in distinguishing between spam and legitimate emails.

# SALES PREDICTION
Excited to share my Sales Prediction Project
As part of my internship with Oasis Infobyte I worked on another Machine Learning task which is Sales Prediction.The goal was to forecast product sales based on factors like advertisement spend and platform used for advertisement.

Project Highlights:
Utilized Python,Scikit-learn,NumPy,Pandas and Matplotlib to develop a robust predictive model.

Implemented Linear Regression model with transformed polynomial features making it a polynomial regression for enhanced accuracy.

Acheived the following performance metrics:
Mean Absolute Error : 0.5493
Mean Squared Error : 0.7749
R-squared : 0.97167

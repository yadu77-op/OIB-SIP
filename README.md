# EMAIL SPAM DETECTION
As a part of my internship with Oasis Infobyte I worked on a Machine Learning task focused on Email Spam Detection.Email spam detection is a classic and relevant machine learning problem, demonstrating the ability to apply classification algorithms to real-world scenarios.

The goal of this project was to classify email as either "spam" or "ham" using advanced machine learning techniques.

Project Highlights:
Utilized Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas , NumPy, Matplotlib to develop a robust predictive model.

Implemented Random Forest Classifier.This specifies the chosen algorithm. Random Forest is an ensemble learning method known for its robustness, accuracy, and ability to handle complex datasets.
Random Forest is a very popular and effective algorithm for classification tasks.

Achieved an accuracy of 97.8%.This quantifies the model's performance. A 97.8% accuracy indicates a high level of effectiveness in correctly classifying emails.
This shows the model was very successful.

Visualised the model's performance using confusion matrix showing its effectiveness in distinguishing between spam and legitimate emails.
